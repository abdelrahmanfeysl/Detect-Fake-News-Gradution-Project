# Detect-Fake-News-Gradution-Project

The main goal of Fake News Detector is to tackle the growing issue of fake news, which has been increasing by the wide-spread use of social media to help people to<br/> be able to differentiate between fake news and fact ones.

This goal is achieved by using an efficient machine learning model that can learn from examples to improve its performance on detecting fake news.
